## <span style="color:#555555"><u> **PRINCIPLES** </u></span>
Our overarching goal as a team is to serve our customers/the Bank through continuous and consistent delivery of quality, valuable software/products.

As we mature as a team, we will continue to update and refine this document so that, as opposed to a prescriptive desktop procedure, it serves as a strong foundation to level set expectations. We will utilize the _Scrum_ framework as our foundation and as a team, we will strive to meet the following principles when collaborating on all software development projects.

- Visibility/Transparency
Involved parties will work together as a unit, to stay accountable to follow-through of responsibilities and to agree upon expectations.

- Inspection
Scrum Team members should meet and communicate frequently to inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward accomplishing the requirements of each Sprint.

- Adaptation
Scrum Team members should consistently seek out new ideas and opportunities to learn, remaining open minded and receptive to change.

### <span style="color:orange"> Sprint </span>

During each Sprint, the Scrum Team works together to complete a potentially releasable product increment. The goal is to have most PBIs included in the Sprint meet the definition of "done". As we move towards better understanding the team's velocity, we will determine if we will bring in extra items that we may not be able to achieve. The goal should be to release work from the sprint at the end of the sprint by utilizing tools such as feature flags to hide code that is not ready to be used in production.

    - Updating their remaining task hours at the end of the day
    - Updating the Sprint backlog statuses as items are completed and moving `Done` items to the bottom of the Sprint backlog
      - All PBIs in a sprint need to be in at least the `Committed` State and must be groomed.
      - PBIs that are `Ready To Test` should be changed to that status and relevant testers notified. (See `Ready to Test` definition below)
      - PBIs that are finished testing should be changed to `Done` if there are no other remaining tasks.
        - If Bugs are found, create a new Task if relevant PBI is still open, otherwise create a new bug with a Related link to the original PBI.
  - PBI and Task owners responsible for maintaining Sprint Backlog

## <span style="color:#555555"> **DEFINITIONS** </span>

Because we all have a different experience level when working with teams using Agile methodologies, we should all set to utilize the below set of terms and definitions when working on software or product projects.

<details>
  <summary><span style="color:hotpink"> EXPAND </span></summary>

- **Accountable**:
Roles called out under this section are expected to produce the output items as well as any pre-work required to achieve them.

- **Blocker**:
Also known as impediments, are anything blocking or slowing the team from doing its work.

- **Daily Standup**:
Meeting with the Development Team and Scrum Master to discuss tasks completed to achieve the Sprint Goal and identify any known blockers. Other members of the Scrum team may attend as needed.

- **Definition of Ready**:
Work items are clearly defined and immediately actionable.

- **Epic**:
Highest level of categorization of work items in Dev Ops. They require a large size of work that has one common objective. Epics can include one or many features, stories, PBIs. Typically, several sprints are required to complete an Epic.

- **Feature**:
A collection of related product backlog items and/or bugs highlighting functionality that delivers business value.

- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**:
Bare minimum product that must be delivered. The goal is to deliver a working product to customer to receive feedback so that future efforts can be tailored accordingly.

- **Product Backlog**:
Product Backlog is an ordered list of all work items that are known to be needed in a product. It is constantly evolving and is never complete.

- **Product Backlog Item (PBI)**:
A distinct piece of functionality that has yet to be delivered for a product. PBIs can include business and/or technical requirements and enhancements.

- **PBI Definition of Done**:
Shared understanding of what it means for a PBI to be complete, to ensure transparency. At minimum the following must be completed prior to end of each Sprint.
	- Tasks are complete
	- Acceptance Criteria is met

- **Product Increment**:
Product Increment is the summation of all Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints.

- **Product Owner/Team**:
Subject matter expert(s) responsible for defining the product and product features. This role is expected to incorporate stakeholder feedback to create the MVP increments every Sprint. Product Owners maintain the product backlog and prioritization.

- **Ready To Test**:
Means that all requirements of PBI (including added tasks for found bugs) are ready to test in the QA environment. Along with changing the PBI to ready to test, the developer must also notify the tester that the PBI is ready to test. If the fixes will be published on the next QA release, the developer may still change the PBI state to `Ready To Test` as long as the notification to the tester includes when the fixes will be available.

- **Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM)**:
Means that PBIs are immediately actionable. The Team must be able to determine what needs to be done and the amount of work required to complete the item.

- **Scrum Artifacts**:
Scrum artifacts are summarized as the Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Product Increments.

- **Scrum Event**:
Also known as Ceremonies, a Scrum event includes the following practices which should be completed with every Sprint: Sprint Planning, Daily Standup, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.

- **Scrum Master**:
Protects the team from both internal and external distractions; holds the Scrum Team accountable to set principles, practices, and to the Scrum framework itself.

- **Scrum Team**:
Inclusive of the responsible parties involved in the Sprint from beginning to end:
	- Product Owners
	- Business Analysts
	- Development Team
	- Scrum Master
	- Project Manager

- **Sizing**:
Relative estimation to help determine the development team's velocity. This is not a time estimation rather a complexity estimation. Sizing standards are as follows:
	Fibonacci sizing/T-shirt sizing conversion
	- 13 (XXL) – Too large, consider breaking down into smaller items or rolling up to a higher categorized item
	- 8 (XL) – Highest complexity for a PBI
	- 5 (L), 3 (M), 2 (S)
	- 1 (XS) – Lowest complexity for a PBI

- **Sprint**:
A dedicated timeframe, between 1 and 4 weeks but typically 2 weeks, where the Scrum Team works together to complete PBIs. Sprints happen one right after the other, with no breaks, to maintain a steady project cadence.

- **Sprint Backlog**:
List of PBIs that the team commits to achieve in each Sprint. Once created, no one can add to the Sprint Backlog except the Development Team.

- **Sprint Goal**:
An objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog work items.

- **Stakeholder(s)**:
All internal parties affected by changes to business processes including new product implementations and changes to existing products.

- **Stories**:
Stories are inclusive of user stories and enabling (technical) stories.

- **User Stories:**
User stories should be created from the "user" persona, for example: As "\_\_\_\_\_" I need "\_\_\_\_" so that I can "\_\_\_\_".

- **Work Items:**
All types of work that exist in the product including epics, features, stories, PBIs, enhancements, bug fixes, and tasks.
