# Introduction to HATEOAS

With the release of v3, we are beginning to implement support for HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) across our API. This is a way of describing the relationships between resources in a RESTful API. By opting in with a header change, the response body of a request will include links to itself and other related resources. HATEOAS is a way of self-documenting an API and making it easier to find the next endpoint that is relevant to the last action taken.

## Example HATEOAS Response
Here is an example of a HATEOAS response from a ```POST trade``` request.

```json
{
  "_links": {
    "_self": {
        "href": "https://api.made.com/v3/api/fx/trade/10001",
        "method": "GET"
    },
    "payment_instructions": {
        "href": "https://api-dev.made.com/v3/api/payment/instructions/10001",
        "method": "GET"
    },
    "connections": {
        "href": "https://api.made.com/v3/api/connections?trade-id=10001",
        "method": "GET"
    },
    "payment": {
        "href": "https://api.made.com/v3/api/fx/payment",
        "method": "POST"
    }
  },
  "trade_id": "10001",
  ...
}
```

Each object in the ```_links``` object includes an ```href``` to that points to the resource and a ```method``` that describes the HTTP method that should be used to access the resource. The first object in the ```_links``` object is always the ```_self``` link that points to the object that was just created, in this case, the trade. The ```trade_id``` was automatically populated in the ```href``` to make it easier to navigate.

Any subsequent objects in the ```_links``` object are links to other resources that are related to the object that was just created. For example, the ```payment_instructions``` object points to the payment instructions for the trade.

## How to Use
By default HATEOAS links are not returned in the response for the request. To return HATEOAS links, a change is needed to the ```Accept``` header. This differs for every endpoint so please refer to the documentation for the endpoint you are using. For example, the ```GET /v3/api/fx/trade``` endpoint supports the following ```Accept``` header: ```application/vnd.made.trade.hateoas+json``` to include HATEOAS links.

All custom made HTTP models (```vnd.made.*```) support adding ```.hateoas``` to the end of the model name to include HATEOAS links in the response.

## Supported Endpoints
Currently the following endpoints are supported:
- All FX endpoints (```/fx/*```)
- Connections (```/connections/*```)
- Payment Instructions (```/payment/instructions```)
