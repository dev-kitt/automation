## Understanding Account History and Payment Details
In order to understand, properly parse, and join transaction and payment details a solid understand of key terms is essential:

***Account history*** - is a reflection of transactions posted (memo or hard) to a bank account on Made’s core system ledger. Note these transactions are final. They are never edited, rather reversal entries made if necessary. Account history is a global view of all transactions.

***Payment history*** - shows deep details of certain payments which are processed via the Made payments hub. Primary examples are domestic wires, international payments, and FX payments. Payment history may be joined with account history via a transaction’s “payment_id”.

***Unique_id*** – is returned in the account history only and is especially useful to help recognize new transactions when polling intraday.

***Payment_id*** – this is an identifier generated by the Made back office payment hub system.

***Transaction codes*** – all account history records have an associated transaction_code which classifies a transaction by type and often by channel as well. Transaction_code labels can be useful when looking to recognize and parse specific types of activity. See details in Specifications section below.

## How Unique ID Is Tied with Transaction Type

The majority of account history transactions reflect back a unique_id immediately, including SEN transfers and all types of wire payments. There is also a group of transaction types for which the unique_id only becomes available after that transaction runs through an initial banking day close process (which occurs only on banking days at roughly 8:00 PM PST). As a result, we hold back in creating and displaying those unique_id values until they are ready. This is why you may return no value, i.e. “unique_id”: “ ”.
